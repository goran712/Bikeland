# Bikeland
Fictional biking travel agency.

The website for a fictional biking travel agency.
Built with pure HTML5 and CSS3, using BEM methodology and SASS.
Cropped three video clips and merged with fade in/fade out effect.
Some features work only in recent versions of modern browsers.
Inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's "Natours".
